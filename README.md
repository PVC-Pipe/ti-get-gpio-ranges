# ti-get-gpio-ranges

Python script to parse a `devicetree.dtsi` file generated by TI's [SYSCONFIG](https://www.ti.com/tool/SYSCONFIG) tool.

Assumes that the user simply selected all of the GPIO available for the relevant device and that SYSCONFIG added which gpio controller each iopad corresponds to in the comments.

When using SYSCONFIG, if there is a pad conflict within the GPIO controller (specifically GPIO1), this is an expected/known error. SYSCONFIG assumes all of the GPIO controllers have the same number of GPIO lines, so if one has less than another, it will try to pinmux a non-existant line.

Usage:

```
$ python3 ti-get-gpio-ranges.py [-h] filename
```
