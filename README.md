# ti-get-gpio-ranges

Python script to parse a devicetree.dtsi file generated by TI's [SYSCONFIG](https://www.ti.com/tool/SYSCONFIG) tool.

Assumes that the user simply selected all of the GPIO available for the relevant device and that SYSCONFIG added which gpio controller each iopad corresponds to in the comments.

Usage:

```
$ python3 ti-get-gpio-ranges.py [-h] filename
```
